'./TGCN.ipynb': Running this porgram can obtain TGCN's performance of identifying pan-cancer driver genes. We adopted the average AUC and the average AUPRC from ten five-fold cross-validations as evaluation indicators.<br>
'./TGCN_sct.ipynb': Running this porgram can obtain TGCN's performance of identifying single-type cancer driver genes. We adopted the average AUC and the average AUPRC from ten five-fold cross-validations as evaluation indicators.<br>
'./indenpend_test.ipynb': Running this porgram can obtain TGCN's performance on independent test sets. We adopted the AUPRC as evaluation indicators.<br>
'./novel_gene.ipynb': Runing this porgram can obtain prediction scores for unlabeled genes, where a higher score indicates a greater likelihood of the gene being a novel cancer driver.<br>
